    "This notebook serves as a basic introduction to differential calculus, with a tensor twist. While there are plenty of resources on differential calculus (e.g., <a href=\"http://www.janmagnus.nl/misc/mdc2007-3rdedition\">Matrix Differential Calculus by Magnus and Neudecker</a>), the way they address tensor derivatives feels like a cop-out: the current solution is to vectorize the inputs and outputs, and use normal matrix differential calculus. This makes derivations involving higher order tensor derivatives to have convoluted forms: in order to use matrix differential calculus, often a number of unnecessary additional vec and kronecker product operations are required to finagle the problem into proper form. \n",
