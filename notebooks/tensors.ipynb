    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Two approaches to teaching linear algebra\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook serves as a basic introduction to tensors from a practitioners perspective. What does this mean? In many math departments, there often exists multiple levels of linear algebra. For example, at CMU there is\n",
    "\n",
    "* 21-241 \"Matrices and Linear Transformations\" - typically aimed at undergraduates that need a working level of linear algebra for their application field, e.g. engineering. This usually takes the approach of teaching linear algebra from the perspective of matrices and vectors of numbers, explaining their operations, properties, and their decompositions. \n",
    "* 21-341 \"Linear Algebra\" - usually taken by math majors/minors. This focuses more on a mathematically rigorous treatment of linear algebra over arbitrary fields, focusing on abstract linear transformations and their corresponding operations, properties, and decompositions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Both courses have their respective strengths: for many people, working with matrix operations is sufficient for their application, and the former course is more than enough. The latter course gives a more abstract perspective which, while providing a more fundamental understanding in how these operations work, is not directly necessary when performing matrix computations. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, when we move on from matrices to tensors, it is easy to find a number of resources from the more mathematical point of view, but more difficult to find a resource that shows how to use tensors from a working perspective. References on tensors tend to explain tensors as linear functionals on vector spaces and dual vector spaces, which automatically assumes a more mathematically rigorous understanding of linear algebra. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why tensors? Tensor differential calculus!\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we need tensors, you might ask? Everything is simple and easy to understand with matrix operations, you might say! I find this tensor algebra (and consequently this notebook) to be highly motivated by matrix differential calculus. With respect to matrix differential calculus, there are resources from both of the two above perspectives. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The commonly used and referenced <a href=\"http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/pubdb/views/edoc_download.php/3274/pdf/imm3274.pdf\">Matrix Cookbook</a> by Kaare Brandt Petersen and Michael Syskind Pedersen contains all the identities and facts about matrices (and consequently matrix derivatives) you would ever use in practice. \n",
    "* For a more mathematical background, one can read <a href=\"http://www.janmagnus.nl/misc/mdc2007-3rdedition\">Matrix Differential Calculus with Applications in Statistics and Econometrics</a> by Jan R. Magnus and Heinz Neudecker. \n",
    "\n",
    "The major limitation of these resources is that they focus primarily on scalar or vector valued functions, with derivatives with respect to scalars or vectors. What happens when you want to take a derivative of a vector valued function with respect to a matrix parameter? Or take a derivative of a matrix valued function with respect to a vector parameter? A very natural extension to higher dimensions of the Jacobian, which is the partial derivatives of a vector valued function, is to have a tensor of partial derivatives. The matrix cookbook avoids this by using elementwise partial derivatives, while the book on matrix differential calculus side-steps the whole idea of tensor differential calculus by simply vectorizing the function inputs and outputs to only work with 2-D Jacobian matrices. \n",
    "\n",
    "While it is possible to turn tensors into combinations of matrix and vector operations, I believe this to be an unnecessary extra step for the practitioner. Sometimes, it can be more clear to derive your equations using tensors instead of being mangled by a number of `vec` and `kronecker` operations to turn it into 2-D calculus. With the usage of differential notation, we can get very clear and elegant derivations. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimization problems\n",
    "\n",
    "The intended use case for this is (but is not limited to) optimization. Standard solutions to optimization problems, $\\min_\\theta f(\\theta)$, usually involve some variation of gradient descent, where the parameters $\\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}^k$ is iteratively updated with the equation \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\theta = \\theta - \\alpha \\nabla f(\\theta)$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where the gradient is usually derived from the problem at hand. For example, the canonical least squares problem, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\min_\\theta \\frac{1}{2}||X\\theta - y||^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "can be solved with gradient descent by iteratively updating with the following gradient: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\nabla \\frac{1}{2}||X\\theta - y||^2 = X^T(X\\theta - y)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculating this gradient for various problems is where matrix differential calculus is typically used. With more problems involving higher dimensional outputs and inputs, this is an opportunity to use tensor differential calculus to simplify all of our derivations. "
